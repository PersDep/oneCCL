Reduce
******

**event CCL_API reduce (const void *send_buf, void *recv_buf, size_t count, datatype dtype, reduction rtype, int root, const communicator &comm, const stream &stream, const reduce_attr &attr=default_reduce_attr, const vector_class< event > &deps={})**

Reduce is a collective communication operation that performs the global reduction operation on values from all ranks of the communicator and returns the result to the root rank.

**Parameters**

* send_buf – the buffer with count elements of dtype that stores local data to be reduced
* recv_buf – [out] the buffer to store reduced result, must have the same dimension as send_buf. Used by the root rank only, ignored by other ranks.
* count – the number of elements of type dtype in send_buf and recv_buf
* dtype – the datatype of elements in send_buf and recv_buf
* rtype – the type of the reduction operation to be applied
* root – the rank that gets the result of reduction
* comm – the communicator for which the operation will be performed
* stream – a stream associated with the operation
* attr – optional attributes to customize operation
* deps – an optional vector of the events that the operation should depend on

**Returns**

ccl::event an object to track the progress of the operation
